# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 10, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress:** Cloned 100 Days repo and started the challenge

**Thoughts:** I have to really focus on what to build. It's okay if the idea isn't perfect or might seem too easy at first. Spending each day practicing/learning will help in the long run

**Link to work:** Nothing to report on yet! Focusing on learning Vue.js. Check out the initial repo for the isItOutYet project! (https://github.com/NicholasChug/isItOutYet) nothing there yet but one day there will be!

### Day 1: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Purchased Brad Traversy's Vanilla Projects course and completed the first project! This class seems great as a refresher for core HTML, CSS and JS skills. Hoping that doing this every day will create a spark for future ideas and get me back into coding each day!

**Link to work:** Check out the reop for the first project, a simple Form Validator (https://github.com/NicholasChug/20WebProjects/tree/master/formValidator)

### Day 2: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked in the AM on the second project in the series. This project allows the user to pick certain seats in a theater and has functionality that stores the options in localStorage and updates the visual UI

### Day 3: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Didn't get time to get to it today! But back on the horse tomorrow! Continuing on with the 20 projects plan to get back into simple project creation

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 4: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on project #3 and front end masters course on vue.js

**Link to work:** No official link really!

### Day 5: March 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on project #4 today! Going to look into the React course on Frontend Masters to see how that looks. Wasn't too excited by Vue.js, but maybe I need to build something with it to understand its functionality better!

### Day 6: March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started the DOM manipulation project but getting fetch error with Firefox. Started work from home so playing with PHP, MySQL and Apache2 setup on home computer

**Link to work:** Nothing yet I'm afraid!

### Day 7: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Alright today was big! Did the modal and navbar responsive layout using just html, css and javascript through Brad's course and loved it. I may implement similar things into my portfolio site which still does not have a dynamic menu system! Also work work today was getting my local environment setup for macsites and php/Wordpress stuff! Feeling very productive!

### Day 19: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** WELL would you look at that. Totally dropped the ball on doing these for the past 10 days but hey, at least I'm back to it? Anyways making progress on my daily dev projects with html, css and JS and it's been really cool to see how much I am retaining after doing just a little bit each day. Thinking when I'm done this course I'll move onto the egghead react course and see what I can pick up.

### Day 22: April 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Picked a React course to follow: Net Ninja on youtube has a pretty in-depth course covering the basics of React and Redux. After this one I will be following along with his React, Redux and Firebase playlist to build a fully featured app!

### Day 23: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Decided instead of getting annoyed and bored with React I'll be starting a new ethical hacking course for a fun change of pace! It's a free udemy course that was advertised on Reddit

**Link to work:** No link to work as of yet but thinking of setting up a new github repo as note tacking for the hacking course

### Day 24: April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked through some of the hacking course. Learned about ip address and the differences between ipv4 and ipv6 which was cool!

**Link to work:** No link to work as of yet but thinking of setting up a new github repo as note tacking for the hacking course

### Day 25: April 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Honestly did not do any coding today which was nice to take the day off! Thought about where to go in my career a little bit in terms of a path.
