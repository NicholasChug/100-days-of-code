# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 10, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Cloned 100 Days repo and started the challenge

**Thoughts:** I have to really focus on what to build. It's okay if the idea isn't perfect or might seem too easy at first. Spending each day practicing/learning will help in the long run

**Link to work:** Nothing to report on yet!
