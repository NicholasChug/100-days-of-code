# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 10, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress:** Cloned 100 Days repo and started the challenge

**Thoughts:** I have to really focus on what to build. It's okay if the idea isn't perfect or might seem too easy at first. Spending each day practicing/learning will help in the long run

**Link to work:** Nothing to report on yet! Focusing on learning Vue.js. Check out the initial repo for the isItOutYet project! (https://github.com/NicholasChug/isItOutYet) nothing there yet but one day there will be!

### Day 1: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Purchased Brad Traversy's Vanilla Projects course and completed the first project! This class seems great as a refresher for core HTML, CSS and JS skills. Hoping that doing this every day will create a spark for future ideas and get me back into coding each day!

**Link to work:** Check out the reop for the first project, a simple Form Validator (https://github.com/NicholasChug/20WebProjects/tree/master/formValidator)

### Day 2: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked in the AM on the second project in the series. This project allows the user to pick certain seats in a theater and has functionality that stores the options in localStorage and updates the visual UI
